# SENG 300 Project Iteration 3 Team 8, Winter 2018

## TO-DO
- Due Date : Apr 9, 2018 7:30 AM

- Overview
> You are to use your analysis tool for finding Java type declarations and references, in order to analyze trends across a set of open-source systems.


- Requirements
> You and your team must select 100 Java-based open-source systems hosted on GitHub, download the source code for the latest version of each, run your analysis tool on each, and analyze the results to address this set of questions:

> > 1) How often are nested types declared?
> > 2) How often are local types declared?
> > 3) How often are anonymous types declared?
> > 4) How often are nested, local, and anonymous types used, compared to other kinds of types?
> > 5) Do you see big differences in these values in different systems?  Speculate about why or why not.

> You and your team must provide a written document (5-7 pages in length, plus the cover page) explaining the following:

> > What are your answers to the above questions?

> > How did you select the 100 systems?

> > How did you collect, record, and analyze the data in order to address the questions?

> > How many bugs did you find in your analysis tool?  Did you rerun earlier systems to make sure that you still obtained the same data?

> > Are the results "correct"? How can we know?

> > How will the results generalize to other Java systems, and to non-Java systems?

> > Are nested, local, and anonymous types worthwhile, considering how they are used in practice and the extra complications that they cause (for developers? for analyzers?)?

> Your document must also address one additional question from the following list:

> > How stable are nested, local, and anonymous types, particularly compared to other types? (Meaning: How much/how often do they change across versions of the same system?) Explain how you would realistically change your analysis tool and the actual analysis procedure in order to answer this question.

> > How buggy are nested, local, and anonymous types, particularly compared to other types? Explain how you would realistically change your analysis tool and the actual analysis procedure in order to answer this question.

> You and your team must provide a Git log that demonstrates who performed commits over time. (This can be used partially as evidence regarding individual opinions.)

## Solution Submission
> You are required to submit:

> > 1) your written document (plus a cover page with the names and student numbers of you and your teammates) as a single PDF document;
> > 2) a ZIP file containing your exported Eclipse project (including your automated test suite);
> > 3) your raw data (e.g., in a spreadsheet); and,
> > 4) your Git log file
